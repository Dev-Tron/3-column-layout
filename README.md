## My process

This is my very first practice and was very confusing at first. I watched a few youtube videos then took a crack at it myself. I started out building the html then I later went into the styles. I started out desktop first which was my major mistake but eventually after a lot of trial and error I started to truly understand.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- (https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I learned about the in depth use display flex and grid as well as the importance of positioning elements on the screen.

### Continued development

I want to continue to further myself with using properties of CSS more effectively. This means I should start implementing the use of SASS into my code.

### Useful resources

- (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHF_PP6yurQ&t=1s) - This helped me for desktop layout design reasons. I really liked the xplenation and will use it going forward.
